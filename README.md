# Post-GoldSRC Team

## Overview

Welcome to the official repository of the Post-GoldSRC Team! Our mission is to port Goldsrc games and content to the Source Engine, ensuring a seamless transition to modern gaming environments.

## What We Do

- Porting Goldsrc Games: We specialize in adapting classic Goldsrc engine games to the Source Engine, preserving the essence of the originals while enhancing them with modern features.

- Content Migration: Our team is dedicated to migrating existing Goldsrc content, including maps, models, and textures, to ensure compatibility and improved visual fidelity in Source.

## Why Choose Source Engine?

The Source Engine offers advanced capabilities, improved graphics, and enhanced performance compared to Goldsrc. By leveraging the power of Source, we aim to breathe new life into beloved classics.
